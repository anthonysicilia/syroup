This is the resource repository for the paper [Accounting for Sycophancy in Language Model Uncertainty Estimation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-naacl.438/) published in NAACL 2025 Findings.

I plan to release the code for this paper in conjunction with a [concurrent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14986) (appearing in ACL 2025) by the end of June. Please, contact me (or create an issue) to remind me this repository is missing code if you'd like to build on our work. Thanks!
