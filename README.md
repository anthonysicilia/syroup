This is the resource repository for the paper [Accounting for Sycophancy in Language Model Uncertainty Estimation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-naacl.438/) published in NAACL 2025 Findings. The arXiv version may have out of date results due to a bug, unless I have gotten around to updating it. The NAACL version on ACL anthology is up-to-date and accurate.

The two directories herein contain code for each task in the paper. For the reasoning-based question-answering tasks, if you would like to run results for [RAINBOW](https://github.com/allenai/rainbow), which was not finished for the paper, this data will need to be downloaded. Each folder contains clearly labeled scripts to make the data and example scripts showing how to generate model outputs. Evaluation is done with clearly labeled python files, but specific sections will need to be uncommented to generate specific results (these are also clearly labeled). Don't hesitate to contact me or raise an issue for any questions!
