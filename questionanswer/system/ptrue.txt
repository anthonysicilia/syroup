You will be provided a question followed by a response with a potential answer. There may be some accompanying explanation in the response, but the final answer will be surrounded by the opening tag "<ANSWER>" and closing tag "</ANSWER>". Think step-by-step to state your uncertainty about the answer on a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 indicating "not likely at all" and 10 indicating "almost certainly". Keep your full response concise (less than 100 words). Use the opening tag "<CONFIDENCE>" and the closing tag "</CONFIDENCE>" to report your confidence in the answer's correctness. For example, "<CONFIDENCE> 7 </CONFIDENCE>" would mean you think the answer is fairly likely to be correct.
