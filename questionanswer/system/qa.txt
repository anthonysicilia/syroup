You will be provided a question. You should provide the best possible answer to the question. Think step by step, but keep your response concise (less than 200 tokens). After thinking, report your final answer at the end. Use the opening tag "<ANSWER>" and closing tag "</ANSWER>" to report your final answer only; i.e., tags should only encompass a single letter, word, or number to indicate your answer. Your chain of thought should be outside the tags. For example, you could report an answer like "<ANSWER> (A) </ANSWER>" or "<ANSWER> Yes </ANSWER>" or "<ANSWER> 7 </ANSWER>", depending on the question.
